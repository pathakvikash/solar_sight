# Overview
This is a specialized repository dedicated to the processing and analysis of solar images. It focuses on detecting and analyzing solar features such as the Sun's limb and sunspots using advanced image processing techniques. This repository aims to provide scripts that are both efficient and accessible, enabling researchers, hobbyists, and educators to explore and study the Sun's dynamic surface with minimal setup.

# Features
- Limb Detection: Automatically detect the Sun's limb (visible edge) and calculate its center coordinates and radius.
- Sunspot Analysis: Generate binary images highlighting sunspots, allowing for further analysis of these fascinating solar phenomena.
- Minimal Dependencies: Designed to use the least number of libraries possible, ensuring ease of use and compatibility.
- Universal Application: Capable of processing several image formats correctly without user modification, making it a versatile tool for solar image analysis.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- OpenCV 
- Astropy => for advanced image processing and FITS file handling

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/pathakvikash/solar_sight.git
